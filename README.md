# network-slicing-project
This project demonstrates network slicing using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment. It creates multiple virtual network slices with isolated resources and customized QoS to manage bandwidth, latency, and improve overall network performance efficiently.
